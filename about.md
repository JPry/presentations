This site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Each individual presentation utilizes the
[WordPress REST API](http://v2.wp-api.org) to load slides from a remote site.
[Remark](http://remarkjs.com/) is used to convert the slides from Markdown to pretty content.
On the site itself, [CMB2](http://cmb2.io) is used to help set up posts to store markdown slides.

Curious about how it works? Check out the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/JPry/presentations).
